> ### **Functionality**🔧
This command-line application was built in **Node.js** environment with implementation of **Inquirer, mysql2, console.table packages** and **MySQL database** to store and retrieve data. <br>
The repository consists of root directory that contains **db** subdirectory with MySQL files and connection point. **Utils** directory has all query files that are separated into 3 section _(refer to the Guide)_ and the main **index.js** is located in the root directory.
<br/><br/>

> ### **Guide**🗒️
Once all dependencies are installed _(can be found in package.json file)_, you can simply run **node index.js** to start interaction with the command line.<br>
For a better user experience the options were divided into **3 sections:**<br>
>> First, you are prompted to simply view all the departments, roles and employees in your organization.<br>
If you would like to add new information about a new department/role or in case you hired a new employee and would like to add them to the team, simply run **_'Make Changes'_** option and you will be able to alter any of those tables individually. <br>
Lastly, there are additional options for more specific needs: filter by department, delete a role in a department or see how much from company's budget goes into employees' compensation in each department.
<br/><br/>

Once you're done using application, select _'Exit'_ <br>
